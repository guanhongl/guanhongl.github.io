<h2 id="what-is-hawaii-home-clinic">What is Hawaii H.O.M.E. Clinic?</h2>

<p>Hawaii Homeless Outreach &amp; Medical Education (H.O.M.E.) Clinic is a mobile clinic that sees patients at various sites around the island. The mission is to improve access to health care for the houseless while understanding their healthcare needs.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>The clinic used Athenahealth Electronic Health Record (EHR) to document ordered drugs and vaccines at the end of an encounter and a Google Forms &amp; Sheets system to log and deduct drugs and vaccines from the master inventory. Manually entering information proved to be a pain point; the process was slow and the supply was inaccurate. It was difficult for the business to manage their supply. <strong>The clinic needed an inventory management system!</strong></p>

<p>The problem was introduced to me during my Software Engineering II course. My team of 8 worked in short sprints with regular communication and using GitHub Project Boards and Issues for agile project management. The app was largely incomplete by the course end, thus, I volunteered to continue and push it to production.</p>

<h2 id="saving-time-saving-resources">Saving Time, Saving Resources</h2>

<p>The proposed solution was to replace the Google Forms &amp; Sheets system with an inventory management app that applies QR codes to each batch of drugs and vaccines. A QR code links to an item’s lot number which uniquely identifies the batch of product produced by a manufacturer. Scanning a QR code opens the item’s information page. And on the page are links to the add and dispense forms auto-populated with the item’s information. Once complete, a log of the transaction is stored and the master inventory is updated. The improved business process provides physicians with numerous benefits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They save time by not having to manually enter information</li>
  <li>Inventory quantities are accurate due to QR code and database integrity</li>
  <li>They can easily access inventory and log information via searches and filters</li>
  <li>They are notified when supply is low or nearing expiration in real-time</li>
</ul>

<p>The app is built with Meteor, a full-stack JavaScript framework that bundles React, MongoDB, and Node.js, and hosted with Meteor Cloud.</p>

<h2 id="integrating-athenahealth-apis">Integrating Athenahealth APIs</h2>

<p>Athenahealth EHR continued to document ordered, administered or dispensed, drugs and vaccines for patients at the end of an encounter. To further save time, I proposed a pipeline to fetch ordered drug and vaccine information for the day to sync to the database; ordered drug and vaccine quantities are auto deducted from the master inventory at night. I coordinated with the EHR vendor to gain API access and design the data pipeline. Using Athenahealth’s <a href="https://docs.athenahealth.com/api/guides/changed-data-subscriptions">Changed Data Subscriptions</a> the app can subscribe to the changed orders feed and fetch the created orders for the day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drugs and vaccines administered or dispensed on Athenahealth are auto deducted from the app’s inventory</li>
  <li>They save time by not having to dispense on the app</li>
  <li>No personal identifiable information is stored on the app</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Due to the new app, the required effort for adding and dispensing supply was reduced. Managing supply was easier, as inventory and log information was structured, which meant happier physicians.</p>

<p>I learned to adapt my solution to the client’s request. Understanding the client’s business process is crucial! I often had to clarify details and rework solutions as new information arrived. What I found most helpful was visiting the clinic and chatting in person.</p>

<h2 id="more-on-meteor">More on Meteor</h2>

<p>Minerva was my deep dive into the Meteor framework. An aspect of Meteor I found brilliant was it does not use the request response cycle for client server interaction! Instead, on client connection a Minimongo instance is created; Minimongo is an in-memory, in-browser implementation of Mongo. Then, the Distributed Data Protocol (DDP) propagates data changes between the server and client databases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimongo serves as a local cache that stores a subset of the database, saving server round trips and providing real-time UX</li>
  <li>The server publishes subsets of the database and the client subscribes to subsets of the database, defining what data changes to propagate</li>
  <li>DDP is the transport</li>
</ul>
